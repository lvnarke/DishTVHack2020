Detailed description:

1. The hybrid based filtering includes features language, location, occasion, age of the viewer and time of the day to make appropriate recommendations. We use a machine learning model to identify the viewer/s. The model will be intelligent enough to understand even the time of day and predict the viewer and recommend accordingly. It can recommend similar channels as well as OTT content. 
2. Watch your favorite TV Shows from the comfort of your home with the company of your friend and family on video chat. We create a seamless experience to join sessions and manage your funtimes during lockdowns as well. This can also act as an avenue to create User Generated Content like reaction channels.

This enables a whole new paradigm for product placements with much higher reach and probable conversion rates. (1 Model)
